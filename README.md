# Angular v17 Demo Application

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of the new features and improvements introduced in Angular v17. Generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.2, it serves as a practical guide to explore the latest Angular capabilities, including deferred loading with `@defer`, enhanced lazy loading strategies, Server-Side Rendering (SSR) optimizations, and more.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` to launch the development server. Visit `http://localhost:4200/` to view the application. Live reloading will reflect any source file changes automatically.

## Code Scaffolding

Use `ng generate component component-name` to create new components. Angular CLI v17 also supports generating other constructs like directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, and modules, facilitating rapid development.

## Build

Execute `ng build` to compile the project. The output will be placed in the `dist/` directory. Angular v17 introduces advanced build optimization techniques, reducing bundle sizes and improving load times.

## Running Unit Tests

`ng test` runs unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io), leveraging the latest testing features and improvements for Angular v17.

## Running End-to-End Tests

`ng e2e` initiates end-to-end testing. Angular v17 has expanded its e2e testing capabilities, supporting a wider range of testing scenarios and platforms.

## Feature Highlights and Demonstrations

### Deferred Loading with `@defer`

Angular v17 introduces `@defer`, allowing components and templates to defer their loading until needed. This demo includes examples of using `@defer` for optimizing initial load performance by delaying the rendering of non-critical components.

### Enhanced Lazy Loading

Building on Angular's lazy loading, v17 enhances support for dynamic imports and introduces more granular control over loading strategies. The demo showcases various lazy loading patterns, improving application scalability and efficiency.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Optimizations

SSR in Angular v17 has been optimized for faster rendering and reduced time-to-first-byte (TTFB). The demo includes examples of SSR configurations and optimizations that leverage these improvements for SEO and performance.

### Improved Form Validation

Angular v17 enhances form validation mechanisms, offering more intuitive and flexible validation processes. The demo application demonstrates these improvements, providing examples of custom validators and validation strategies.

### Angular CLI Enhancements

The Angular CLI v17 includes new commands and options for improved development workflows. This project utilizes these enhancements for streamlined building, testing, and deployment processes.
